### Introduction:
Welcome to our Digimarket project, designed specifically for kids! As the world continues to shift towards digital learning, it is more important than ever to provide high-quality educational resources that are both engaging and accessible. Our platform aims to do just that, offering a fun and interactive way for children to learn and grow from the comfort of their own homes while simulating the in-person classroom experience as much as possible.

With our platform, organizations can collaborate with their all team members, parents and students in a private workspace and modify roles and responsibilities of each member as per their needs. From creating lessons to scheduling and using lesson’s content in interactive classrooms, every step can be handled through the platform.


Through a combination of videos, games, quizzes, and other interactive activities, our platform provides a comprehensive educational experience that is tailored to the unique needs and interests of children. We believe that education should be accessible to all, regardless of background or location. That's why our platform is designed to be easily accessible from any device with an internet connection.
